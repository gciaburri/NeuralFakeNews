# To clone/ build: 
Clone NeuralFakeNews in terminal, cd into NeuralFakeNews, run app.py 

# What the code does: 
app.py gives a few options for displaying the data (stored in articleResults) we obtained by inverting several articles through different LLMs and passing the inversions through Grover. We tested Grover to see if it could detect the AI inverted articles, and then we compared the LLMs looking to see which Grover performed best against. The code gives the user options for displaying these results
